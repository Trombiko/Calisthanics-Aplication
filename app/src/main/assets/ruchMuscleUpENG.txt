1. We start with a full overhang, swinging slightly while holding the "hollow body" position.
2. When we sense the moment when we start swinging backwards, we perform a dynamic pull-up trying to come out as high as possible.
3. When the rod is at the height of the sternum, we move the elbow over the rod by twisting the wrists - while moving we break at the hips.
4. When we are already at the bar we are doing a pump on the handrail (so-called bar dip) - we straighten the arms and tighten the biceps.
